# Basics
In tap there are 5 basic commands:
1. Thumb
2. Index
3. Middle
4. Ring
5. Pinky
6. End

Each of these commands correspond with a finger on your hand.

Ontop of these 5 basic commands there are 3 modifiers.
1. Soft
2. Medium
3. Hard

These modifiers specify how loudly you tapped your specified finger.

Just like in a modal editor in tap you enter modes to do certain things.


## Thumb
The thumb is used to interact with variables

## Index
Index is used to print and retrieve data from user

## Middle
Middle finger is used to indicate error (as a middle finger to the programmer the louder the tap the worse the error is)
middle silent is equal to info
middle medium is equal to warning
middle hard is equal to error

## Ring
Ring is used for loops because a ring is a loop
if:
  this is ture
then:
  execute this
else:
  execute this

ring soft:
  this is true
ring medium:
  execute this
ring hard:
  execute this

## Pinky
Pinky is used for if statements like pinky promise


Q: How to do loops? maybe a keyword like all referencing that all fingers are used. So all soft, all medium or all loud
