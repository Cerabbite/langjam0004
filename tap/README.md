Theme: The sound(ness) of one hand typing
- Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koan#The_sound_of_one_hand

A language in which you record yourself typing -- then the speed and stuff is what determens what it will do?

How it will work:
The language is a combination of audio processing and image processing. By using a different finger at a different speed or loudness you can create different values.

I only need a format to store the program that is written. -- Does this count as an programming language or IDE? Need to come up with some more ideas.


Thumb: 1
Index: 2
Middle: 3
Ring: 4
Pink: 5

Soft (No Sound):
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Middle (Little Sound):
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Loud (Loud Tap):
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

There needs to be some logical system behind how each tap influences the program. Also make sure there is a backspace -- swipe motion could be a fun backspace.

The format could literally be:
loud 1
middle 1
soft 5

So when typing is is just automatically converting your moves to that simple markup which then when ran gets turned into the actual program.

I should start by implementing the simple written form and finish that before saturday evening and then write the audio and image processor on saturday evening and sunday.
